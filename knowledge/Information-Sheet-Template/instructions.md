# How to use this INTERLINKER
This template guides the preparation of an information sheet that contains information about a co-production project to be handed out to participants engaged in project activities. It briefly explains the purpose of involving stakeholders, the type of input that is expected from them, how the collected data will be managed, protected and used, what rights participants have with respect to their data and how they can exert those rights.
Some parts of the information sheet can be tailored according to the specific event / activity / experiment the participants will be involved in, for example to list exactly the type of data that will be collected.
A copy of the Information Sheet should remain with the participant.
