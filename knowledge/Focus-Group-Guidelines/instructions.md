# How to use this INTERLINKER
Focus groups allow you to gather a range of information and perspectives in a short time period in an encouraging way. They are particularly useful during the initial stages of a co-production process to bootstrap the **investigation of current practices** in the creation and delivery of a public service, as well the collection of **needs and desiderata** for improved and new services. 

This INTERLINKER provides **a list of operational steps** to help you set up a research investigation based on focus groups for your co-production project.  It includes **a template for writing down the research plan** underlying a (set of) focus group(s).

*TIP: Given the potential variety of the topics to investigate, their context and the different participants to involve, it is advisable to prepare a brief research plan for each round of focus groups to conduct, to enable accountability and facilitate data collection and analysis.*
