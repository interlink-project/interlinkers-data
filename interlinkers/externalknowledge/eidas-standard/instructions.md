# How to use this INTERLINKER
The CEF eID building block is a set of services (including software, documentation, training and support) provided by the European Commission and endorsed by the Member States, which helps public administrations and private Service Providers to extend the use of their online services to citizens from other European countries. This is realised through the mutual recognition of national electronic identification (eID) schemes (including smartcards, mobile and log-in), allowing citizens of one European country to use their national eIDs to securely access online services provided in other European countries. The mutual recognition of eID schemes across Europe is mandated by the eIDAS Regulation. The Regulation states that by 29 September 2018 all online public services requiring electronic identification  assurance  corresponding to a level of 'substantial' or 'high' must be able to accept the  notified  eID schemes of other EU countries. Public administrations offering online services that match these requirements are therefore obliged to comply.
