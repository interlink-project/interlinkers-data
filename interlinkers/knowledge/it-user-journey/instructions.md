# How to use this INTERLINKER
1.
For each identified user-type (personas), fill in the header of the user Journey sheet, choosing a title that inspires the narration. The different typical users represent different experiences in using the same service.

Reflect on the three macro-phases of the journey considering what happens before, during and after the interaction with the service. If you find it useful, you can add additional phases (columns) to better describe the experience of using the service.
3.
Start working by columns, describe in a narrative way what the typical user experience is, focusing on the activities he carries out in the different phases, detailing the possible actors and touchpoints involved for each.
4.
Finally, re-read the journey to verify consistency and focus on highlighting critical issues that the user may encounter during his/her journey.
