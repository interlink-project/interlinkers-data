# How to use this INTERLINKER
A semi-structured interview is a method of research used to explore a specific set of dimensions. It is organized as an open conversation to allow new ideas to be brought up as a result of the conversation dynamics.  A semi-structured interview guides the interviewed person without imposing strict questions. This freedom allows the interviewers to tailor the questions to specific interview context and to the specific individual they are interviewing. Still, the interviewer in a semi-structured interview generally has a framework of themes to be explored. It is helpful for interviewers to have a topic guide pre-prepared which dimensions, topics and questions that the interviewer can ask in different ways for different participants.

This INTERLINKER provides a list of operational steps to help you set up a research investigation based on semi-structured interviews for your co-production project. 

## 1.
Identify the topics to discuss with the interested stakeholders and try to structure the issues in a way that is flexible, bearing in mind that you could interview very different figures. List the themes (and the time you want to dedicate to each of them) at the beginning.

## 2.
The first section is dedicated to the introduction of the project. This is a part that serves to contextualize the reason for the involvement. It is important to clearly explain that the participant's perspective is useful in guiding them to better understand the dynamics of the service area. Customize the blank fields to the specific context of your interview.

## 3.
The second section aims to better understand the intervieweeâ€™s profile, what is his role and his duties; it includes general questions to outline the type of profile you have in front of you, to best fit subsequent questions.

## 4.
If necessary, specify or modify the suggested themes, write a short reflection for each one, as an incentive to orient the conversation and then be able to ask in-depth questions (max 2/3 per theme).
