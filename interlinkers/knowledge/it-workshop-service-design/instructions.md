# How to use this INTERLINKER
Involve stakeholders and service users in a co-design session
1.
Identify what goals you want to achieve during the workshop session. Based on the objectives, identify the participants you want to invite. Remember that it is important to represent all points of view, from users to stakeholders of the PA.
2.
Set a day, time and place for the workshop, and distribute invitations to attendees. In the invitation, clarify what the goal of the session is, and if they need to prepare in some way (eg by reading a document).
3.
Define the agenda for the workshop session, identifying a series of exercises to be done together (you can choose from those proposed in the kit or invent new ones). You will find in this document two examples of possible agendas.
4.
Edit this presentation document to be able to use it as a moderation aid by showing participants the objectives of each activity at launch and accompanying the various stages throughout the day.
