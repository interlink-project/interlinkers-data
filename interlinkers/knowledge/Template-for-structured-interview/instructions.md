# How to use this INTERLINKER
Structured interviews are standardized interviews to collect information from heterogeneous people with different backgrounds and perspectives. They have the goal to ensure that each interview is presented with exactly the same questions in the same order to all the interviewees. This ensures that answers can be easily aggregated and that comparisons can be made with confidence between sample sub groups or between different survey periods.

This INTERLINKER provides a list of operational steps to help you set up a research investigation based on structured interviews for your co-production project. 

## 1.
Compile the list of topics to be discussed with the participant, organize them so that you can gradually get to deal with the more complex issues and indicate how much time to dedicate to each, in order to estimate the duration of the session overall (usually 45, 60 or 90 minutes ). List the themes (and times) in the initial part as the structure of the interview.

## 2.
The first section of the protocol is dedicated to the introduction of the session. This is a standard part of the user interview, in which it is important to clearly explain the rules and methods of carrying out the activity. Customize the orange fields according to the specific context of your interview.

## 3.
The second section aims to better understand the intervieweeâ€™s profile, what is his role and his duties; it includes general questions to outline the type of profile you have in front of you, to best fit subsequent questions.

## 4.
Specify or modify the suggested topics, start listing all the questions you would like to ask the user, divided into the various chapters relating to the topics to be discussed. When writing the questions, always remember to move from the general to the specific, according to a logical path, and to favor open-ended questions, which can be a starting point for conversing on the subject.

## 5.
Once you have finished the protocol structure, use it to create the outline to follow when taking notes during each interview. It is not necessary to follow the list of questions in a timely manner, but it is advisable to keep an eye on the guide for id and be sure not to forget any points.
