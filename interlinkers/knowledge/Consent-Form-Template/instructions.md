# How to use this INTERLINKER
This template guides the preparation of a form that can be used to collect consent from participants engaged in co-production activities about the storage and use of the data they contribute. It should be distributed together with a copy of the information sheet that describes the project within which activities are organized. 
Some parts of the consent form can be tailored according to the specific event / activity / experiment the participants will be involved in, for example to list exactly the type of data that will be collected. If changes are introduced, a careful check is required to guarantee that the version of the Consent Form and of the Information Sheets that are distributed to participants are consistent. 
The consent form should  be signed and dated in the presence of the participant.
A copy signed by all parties should be given to the participant and one kept by the researcher and filed in a secure location.
