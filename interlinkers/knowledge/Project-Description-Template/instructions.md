# How to use this INTERLINKER
Drafting a project description at the beginning of a collaborative initiative is very important to identify addressed problems and scenarios, orient the following stages of stakeholders network building, and provide the starting point for communication and collaborative service design. This document provides a template on how to describe the main aim and expected benefit of establishing a collaborative network of stakeholders and engaging them in the co-production process.
This template can be downloaded and filled in with the information of your own project. You can also use the online, digital template directly offered inside the INTERLINK platform for the same purpose.

TIP: The project description can be iteratively refined as the project progresses. It is important to try and prepare an initial description at the beginning to focus ideas and share views. But refinement and integration is the norm.
