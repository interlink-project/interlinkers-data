# How to use this INTERLINKER
This document can be used to design a Stakeholder Engagement Plan.

A stakeholder engagement plan—also known as a stakeholder management plan—is a subsidiary document that is often created alongside the main project plan for a given body of work. It is a written document that is formulated before a project begins, and which is kept on file and updated over the course of the project as necessary. Its purpose is to identify a project’s key stakeholders, and to outline a methodology and approach for how the project team will interact and communicate with those stakeholders. 

Simply put, stakeholder engagement is about figuring out how to effectively communicate, collaborate, and interact with key people who have positive or negative influence, and may impact the success of your project,

This document will allow you to complete the following sections:
1) Stakeholder Identification
2) Planning to Interact with the Stakeholders
3) Stakeholder Engagement Activities
