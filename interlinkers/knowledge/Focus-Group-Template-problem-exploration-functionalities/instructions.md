# How to use this INTERLINKER
This template can be used to prepare a presentation to facilitate a focus group investigating the current and desired practices of co-production within an organization.

## 1. Set the research plan of the Focus Group
Follow the steps in the Guidelines for Focus Groups to define the main objective, themes and organizational details for the Focus Group

## 2. Customise the slides in this template according to your project goals
The slides can be used to pace the discussion during the focus group, helping the participants understand which are the investigated themes and how the finding will be used

## 3. Prepare a collaborative space and complementary material  to be used during the meeting
Focus groups are more productive when participants contribute to a practical task (e.g., filling in post-its with position statements, completing canvases, composing scenarios, reordering thematic cards) . Whether the focus group is organized in presence or online, a collaborative space should be prepared to host participants' contributions
