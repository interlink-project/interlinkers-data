# How to use this INTERLINKER
1.
Choose one of your Personas, tell what situation he/she is in and what he / she needs from the public service.
2.
Define what your pids are and / or needs are with respect to the goal.
Then focus on the context in which he/she benefits from the service, answering the question: where and when does the interaction take place?
3.
Try to describe in detail what specific activities he/she must perform to reach his goal and highlight which limits or constraints of the current service can represent critical points.
4.
Imagine possible solutions, explained in terms of content and requirements for the future digital service. Then, copy them into the Card Sorting tool: each of them will represent a “card”.
