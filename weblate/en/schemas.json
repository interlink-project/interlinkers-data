    "default;description": "The INTERLINK project has defined a generic co-production process which can accommodate any co-production endeavour. It is composed of two main phases to be followed by co-producers: a) Co-design phase. It concerns activities that incorporate 'the experience of users and their communities' into the creation, planning, or arrangements of public services. In it, the co-production team is created and starts working together to define the service to be co-produced. This phase entails two sub-phases: Engagement and Design; and b) Co-delivery phase. It is a joint effort by public authorities and stakeholders to provide and improve public services where the service is implemented and delivered in a sustainable manner. The co-delivery phase entails two sub-phases: Build and Sustain.",
